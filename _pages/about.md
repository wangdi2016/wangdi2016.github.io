<p>As a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist and Bioinformatics manager, lead the Research Analysis Support Group of the Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory (CGR), operated by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. for the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI) (<a href="https://dceg2.cancer.gov/cgi-bin/Personnel.pl?1=ALL" target="_blank">DCEG Staff</a>). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research is focused on analyzing genomic data (DNASeq and RNASeq) to gain knowledge in preventing human cancers and improving human health. My recent work focuses on analyses of whole transcriptomics, gene fusion, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, mutational signature, GWAS and polygenic risk score, spatial genomics, single-cell sequencing, and PacBio long reads sequencing.</p>

My research is at the intersection of genomics and computing, with a core emphasis on variant and copy number analysis, gene expression, microbiome, and proteomics studies. My current endeavors revolve around identifying genomic signatures and protein targets for drug discovery in movement disorders, particularly Dystonia and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. My involvement extends to other significant initiatives, including disease modeling using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) for Lesch-Nyhan disease and DYT1 dystonia within the Hess-Jinnah Research Group.

* _Signatures of somatic mutations from HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)_  
Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of HNSCC of the oropharynx. We combined DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC).

* _Rectal microbiome composition correlates with humoral immunity to HIV-1 in vaccinated rhesus macaques_  
We assessed the longitudinal changes in vaginal and rectal microbiome profiles following intradermal immunization with an HIV-1 DNA vaccine in adult rhesus macaques that received two prior DNA primes. The rectal and vaginal (CVL) microbiota showed compositional differences at lower taxonomic levels. As demonstrated by the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) plot, microbiome in vaginal and rectal compartments demonstrated characteristic phylotype abundances.
